    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Takoyaki, or Grilled Octopus Balls, are one of Japan’s best-known street
      food that originated in Osaka. Whether you make a traditional style with
      bits of octopus or other alternatives, these ball-shaped dumplings are fun
      to make with your friends and family!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dashi-flavored batter</li>
      <li>Octopus</li>
      <li>Beni Shoga (pickled red ginger)</li>
      <li>Green onion</li>
      <li>Tenkasu or Agedama (Tempura scraps)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix. Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury
        bits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep. Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green
        onions and make sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of
        oil, all your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate
        to serve on. Heat up the pan
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour and fill. Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel
        dipped in oil. Give the batter a whisk then pour into the individual
        compartments all the way up to the top. It's okay if they overflow a
        bit. Add in the fillings and let cook until the edges start to look more
        solid and opaque
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip. Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don't
        easily move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they're at a 90°
        angle, pour in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. Let cook,
        stuffing in any excess batter that's outside the ball, then turn again.
        You should have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown,
        moving the balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is
        because most pans will have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it
        will be easier to flip them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauce. When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and
        brush with takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo. Top. Finish with a
        sprinkle of bonito and aonori. Enjoy!
      </li>
