      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        1 quart (950ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium broth
      </li>
      <li>1 quart (950ml) homemade or instant dashi (see note)</li>
      <li>
        1 pound (450g) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
      </li>
      <li>
        Half of one 6-ounce apple, peeled, cored, and finely grated, minced, or
        pur√©ed
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the Curry Spice Blend: In a spice grinder, combine coriander, cumin,
        fenugreek, cardamom, black peppercorns, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, star
        anise, and orange peel (if using) and grind to a fine powder. Empty into
        a small bowl and combine with turmeric, chili powder, and nutmeg, then
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Stew: Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. In a large
        Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken
        and cook, turning, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes.
        Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion to Dutch oven, lower heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring,
        until golden, about 10 minutes. Add carrots and cook for 4 minutes. Add
        chicken stock and dashi and bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce
        heat to maintain a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut up chicken into bite-size pieces and add back to pot, along with any
        accumulated juices. Add potatoes and apple and cook at a gentle simmer
        until potatoes are tender and carrots can easily be pierced with a fork,
        about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until
        foaming. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until roux is a deep caramel
        brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in ginger and 3 tablespoons (25g) Curry
        Spice Blend and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape roux into stew pot, stir well, and simmer until broth has
        thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in peas, if using, and cook
        until heated through.
      </li>
      <li>Serve curry with cooked rice and pickled ginger and/or rakkyo.</li>
